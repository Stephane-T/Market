# market

Market is a API to build a crypto/currencies trading place.

It's a work in progress and not usable at this point. 

The purpose of this project is to learn Clojure and use as much as possible things from
Clojure to build an API.

You can use it as a sample to build an API with Clojure. The trading function is not
finished, but all the wallet stuff is working fine.

## Prerequisites

You will need Clojure to run and compile the project.

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
